We don\'t walk as much, letting our autos do our walking.... We don\'t read if we don\'t have to. We don\'t calculate. We are in the process of offloading our remembering to Google, and we are eager to stop cleaning as soon as those cleaning bots get cheap enough.'

    "quote": 'So why not steer everyone in this direction? Why don\'t we all give up more choices and become Amish? After all, Wendell Berry and the Amish see our multimillion choices as illusory and meaningless, or as choices that are really entrapments. I believe these two different routes for technological lifestyle—either optimizing contentment or optimizing choices—come down to very different ideas of what humans are to be.'
